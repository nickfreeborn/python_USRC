# If someone asked you to add '5' and 'potato', you'd probably get confused.
# In computing, this concept is called types. Different variables can have 
# different types. For example:

p = 5
print(type(p))

p = 2.5
print(type(p))

p = "hello world"
print(type(p))

p = []
print(type(p))

# This concept is important because sometimes when performing operations, 
# you may not get the results you want. For example, try these, one line 
# at a time, by un-commenting them (remove the #):

#print(5 + 5)
# print("5" + "5")
# print("5" + 5)
# print(20 / 5)
# print(2 / 5)
# print(2.0 / 5)

# You can also convert between types if necessary.

# print("5" + 5)
# print("5" + str(5))
# print(int("5") + 5)
